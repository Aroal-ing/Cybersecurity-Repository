## About Me
I am a Computer Systems Engineering student with a specialization in Cybersecurity and Networking.
I have hands-on knowledge in:
-Linux fundamentals
-Common vulnerabilities and basic exploitation techniques
-Technical documentation of security findings

Additionaly, i have foundational to intermediate knowledge in networking, including:
-Network architecture (LAN and WAN)
-Logical an Physical network implemetation 
-Structured cabling
-Site deployment and infrestructure setup 
-Configuration of switches and routers
-Internet administration and access control
-Wireless Access Points (APs)
-CCTV systems and NVR-DVR configuration

My main interest lies in understaning how vulnerabilities originate, how they can be explited, and how to properly mitigate them to improve security posture.

This repository documents my practical learning process through controlled lab environments and real word inspired scenarios.
